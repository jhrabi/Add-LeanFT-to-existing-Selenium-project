# Add-LeanFT-to-existing-Selenium-project

This project has two branches. 
- master is a branch that is a pure IntelliJ Selenium project against AOS.
- AddLeanFT is a branch that has modified the imports to allow working with LeanFT OIC

The AddLeanFT branch has two LeanFT specific objects. The more interesting is the tabletToSelect, which shows the LeanFT ByEach object constructor, which shows how easy it is to use complicated object constructors. It has a looping structure just to show that it works, randomly selecting from the available tablets.
